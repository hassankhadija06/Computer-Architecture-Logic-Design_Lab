🔧 Experiments Performed
1. 🧩 Basic Logic Gates
https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/and-gate.png https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/xor-gate.png

Verified AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR gates

Used ICs: 7400, 7402, 7404, 7408, 7432, 7486

Confirmed all truth tables match theory

Sample Truth Table (AND Gate):

A	B	Output
0	0	0
0	1	0
1	0	0
1	1	1
2. ⚡ Advanced Circuits
🔀 NAND/NOR Implementation
Built simple circuits using ICs

Created complex versions using basic gates

plaintext
NAND = NOT(AND(A,B))  
NOR = NOT(OR(A,B))
🧮 Half Adder Design
https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/electrical.png

Simple version: XOR + AND gates

Complex version: Only NOT/AND/OR gates

Verified all cases (00→0, 01→1, 10→1, 11→0)

📊 DeMorgan's Law Proof
NAND Case
math
(A·B)' = A' + B'
NOR Case
math
(A+B)' = A'·B'
Verification Table:

A	B	NAND	NOT A + NOT B
0	0	1	1
0	1	1	1
1	0	1	1
1	1	0	0
